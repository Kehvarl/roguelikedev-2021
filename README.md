At [r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/) we're doing a dev-along following [The Complete Roguelike Tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/libtcod/1).
This version will be following the [Common Lisp Roguelike Tutorial (CL-RLTUT)](https://nwforrer.github.io/categories/roguelike-tutorial/).

## Roguelike 2021
This roguelike is going to follow the Common-Lisp + BearLibTerminal tutorial through at least Chapter 6.
